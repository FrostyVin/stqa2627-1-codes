### Solution to step 1

```gherkin
Feature: Hit Counter
    As a website visitor
    I want to be able to click a button to make the counter go up
    So that I can see how many times I have clicked the button

Scenario: The counter goes up when the button is clicked
    Given the counter is reset
    When a user clicks the "Hit" button
    Then the counter should be at 1
    When a user clicks the "Hit" button
    Then the counter should be at 2
```

### Solution to step 2

```py
from behave import given, when, then
import requests

@given('the counter is reset')
def step_impl(context):
    """Resets the hit counter via an API call."""
    response = requests.post(f"{context.base_url}/reset")
    assert response.status_code == 200

@when('a user clicks the "Hit" button')
def step_impl(context):
    """Simulates a hit button click with an API call."""
    response = requests.post(f"{context.base_url}/hit")
    assert response.status_code == 200

@then('the counter should be at 1')
def step_impl(context):
    """Verifies that the counter has the expected value."""
    response = requests.get(f"{context.base_url}/")
    assert f'<span id="counter">1</span>' in response.text

@then('the counter should be at 2')
def step_impl(context):
    """Verifies that the counter has the expected value."""
    response = requests.get(f"{context.base_url}/")
    assert f'<span id="counter">2</span>' in response.text
```

### Solution to Step 4

```gherkin
Scenario: The counter resets to zero when the reset button is clicked
    Given the counter is reset
    When a user clicks the "Hit" button
    When a user clicks the "Hit" button
    Then the counter should be at 2
    When a user clicks the "Reset" button
    Then the counter should be at 0
```
```py
@when('a user clicks the "Reset" button')
def step_impl(context):
    """Simulates a reset button click with an API call."""
    response = requests.post(f"{context.base_url}/reset")
    assert response.status_code == 200

@then('the counter should be at 0')
def step_impl(context):
    """Verifies that the counter has the expected value."""
    response = requests.get(f"{context.base_url}/")
    assert f'<span id="counter">0</span>' in response.text
```
